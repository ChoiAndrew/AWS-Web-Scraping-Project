# AWS-Web-Scraping-Project
The program communicates with Amazon AWS SNS to send messages through the console.

This project is designed to scrape data off of websites and send the data to a list of subscribed users by interacting with Amazon's AWS API. Used JSoup library to extract data online. For example with the program attached, I used Jsoup to extract the list of top movies from the IMBD site and send it to all the subscribed AWS users through text and email.
