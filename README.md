# AWS-Web-Scraping-Project
Program communicates with Amazon AWS SNS to send messages through the console

This project is designed to scrape data off of websites and send the data to a list of subscibed users by interacting with Amazons AWS API. 
Used JSoup library to extract data online. For example with the program attatched, I used Jsoup to extract the list of top movies from the IMBD site and send it to all the subscribed AWS users through text and email.
